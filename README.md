 ## Branch purpose:

 This branch was created by Dan and is where code for stopping behavior will be worked on.  
 
 I currently have no experience with writing nodes and using ros. I will be adding comments to other
 files like route_planner_node.py and route_planner.py as a way to keep note of things I am learning so I can apply it to my code. 

## The stopping behavior

a node is to be created that will know when a stop sign is detected and then stop the car at the desired point.  Then the car will switch back to driving
  -the node will know it needs to stop based on Diep's sign detection or from the Carla api.  

another node I plan on making is for stop lights

there also has to be code written that will allow the car to switch behaviors


## Questions I have

Should there be an individual node for each stopping scenario? Like one node for a stop sign, one for a stop light, and another for stopped cars or obstacles?
